🌐 Overall Design & Feel

The BuddyShop interface should have a modern Gen-Z aesthetic — clean, minimal, and intuitive. The primary color palette combines soft mint green, lavender blue, and off-white backgrounds, giving a calm and futuristic tone. Fonts like Poppins or Inter keep the text readable and youthful. Buttons are rounded with glassy transparency and subtle shadows, while icons follow a line-art style similar to Zepto or Flipkart. The theme supports both light and dark modes, and transitions between screens are smooth and animated.

At the very top of every page is a sticky header bar containing three main elements — a search bar, a switch for toggling between Global Mode (like Flipkart) and Local Mode (like Zepto), and small icons for the user’s cart and profile. The search bar supports text and voice input, instantly filtering products as you type. When you toggle the mode switch, the product feed and backend API change seamlessly — in global mode you see online marketplace items, and in local mode you see nearby store inventories.

🏠 Home Page (User Interface)

When a user opens BuddyShop, the homepage is clean and modular. Below the header, a location bar shows the user’s current city and offers an option to “Set Route.” Tapping that opens a map-based route planner. This is followed by a horizontal banner slider displaying promotional cards — such as festive discounts, trending local deals, or combo offers.

Next comes the category scroller, a horizontal list of chips (like “Groceries,” “Electronics,” “Fashion,” etc.), each styled with minimal icons and color-coded gradients. When a user selects a category, the main content area below reloads with relevant product cards.

The product grid follows a two-column layout, with each product card displaying an image at the top, followed by its name, price, star rating, and availability indicator. When the app is in Local Mode, a small line under the title shows “Available at 3 nearby stores,” along with an estimated arrival time if delivery is supported. Each card also has a rounded “Add to Cart” button and a small compass icon labeled “Add to Route,” which allows users to build their shopping journey.

At the bottom right corner, there’s a floating action button that opens a bottom sheet panel for filters and sorting. The filter sheet includes toggles for “Sort by Distance,” “Sort by Price,” “Sort by Rating,” and a switch for “Show Open Stores Only.” This sheet appears with a soft upward animation and a blurred glassy background for a premium touch.

🗺️ Custom Route & Filters

When users choose “Set Route” from the header or click “Add to Route” on products, a map modal appears, occupying the bottom half of the screen. The upper part displays a small interactive map (powered by Google Maps or Mapbox), while below it there’s a list of added stops — these are the stores selected for pickup. Users can reorder stops by dragging, or tap “Add Stop” to insert another shop. They can also set preferences like “Shortest Distance” or “Lowest Price Priority.” Once confirmed, the route can be saved and reused later. The entire modal has rounded corners and feels light — similar to Zepto’s delivery cart design.

📄 Product Detail Page

Tapping a product card opens a detailed view page. At the top is a large image carousel with smooth horizontal swiping, followed by the product’s name, price, description, and expandable specification sections. Below that, there’s a “Nearby Availability” block showing which stores around the user have this product in stock, along with their prices, distances, and ratings. Each store entry has two buttons: “Pick & Go” (for in-store pickup) and “Order for Delivery.”

Towards the bottom, three large rounded buttons appear — “Add to Cart,” “Pick from Store,” and “Add to Route.” If the user selects a local pickup, the app shows a confirmation with a QR code at checkout to verify in-store pickup later.

🛒 Cart and Checkout Flow

The Cart Page dynamically changes depending on the user’s mode.
In Global Mode, it looks like any online shopping cart — listing items, showing delivery options, and allowing address input.
In Local Mode, however, a mini route map appears at the top, showing all the added stores and the sequence in which the user plans to visit them. The bottom part includes options to choose between “Self Pickup” or “Delivery from Shop.” For self-pickup, the app generates a QR code and estimated store wait time; for delivery, it follows a Zepto-like live tracking interface once the order is confirmed.

📦 Order Tracking Page

This page provides a real-time map showing either the delivery vehicle or the list of stores pending pickup. In local pickup mode, each store’s card updates with status indicators such as “Ready,” “Picked,” or “Pending.” For deliveries, a moving marker shows the driver’s route. The UI keeps this simple with light animations and clear visual states.

🧑‍💼 Shop Owner Dashboard (Seller Side)

For shop owners, the dashboard opens to a clean interface with summary cards showing total sales, items in stock, and pending orders. The layout resembles Khata or Instamojo — simple, clear, and mobile-friendly. Below the summary is an inventory section, where each product is listed with its image, name, and current stock. Shop owners can quickly adjust stock quantities inline, toggle “List Online” or “Local Only” modes, and decide how many units should appear online. This allows partial visibility — for example, keeping 50 units listed online out of 200 available.

There’s also an “Add Product” button that opens a minimal form with fields for name, image upload, price, and quantity. The “Orders” tab displays active local and online orders with options to mark as “Packed,” “Out for Delivery,” or “Ready for Pickup.”

At the bottom, the Settings Page lets shop owners configure their payment methods (UPI or bank), set delivery options, and define their working hours. A location pin setup ensures their store appears correctly on the local map when users nearby search.

⚙️ Feature Integration Flow

Every feature is woven naturally into the UI. The Global/Local toggle in the top bar switches data sources seamlessly — in global mode it connects to a centralized API like Flipkart’s, and in local mode it pulls data from registered stores near the user’s location. The “Set Route” option interacts with a map API to optimize the best path, while the filters and sorting apply logic directly on the local dataset. Delivery and pickup systems share the same order infrastructure, but their display and tracking interfaces adapt based on the chosen mode.

The goal is to make everything feel continuous and intuitive — no sharp transitions between local and online experiences. Whether users are ordering a gadget for home delivery or picking up snacks from three nearby stores, the design flows consistently.

🎨 User Experience Notes

Animations are kept soft and meaningful. Product cards fade in as they load. Filter sheets slide smoothly from the bottom. Buttons have short pulse effects on tap. There’s also voice support for search and filters (e.g., “show cheapest nearby rice”). Swipe gestures are supported — swiping right on a product adds it to the cart, and swiping left adds it to the route. The dark mode has deeper contrasts but keeps accent colors vibrant.

Overall, BuddyShop feels like a bridge between an online marketplace and a hyperlocal shopping assistant, with the simplicity of Khata, the speed of Zepto, and the scale of Flipkart — all within a unified, modern interface.
